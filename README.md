# Flowers for EmsieðŸŒ¸  

A hexagonal, block-based random maze generator and the randomly spawned flowers in it.   
Emsie the goat has to water the flowers each day before she runs out of stamina.  

The Minimum Viable Product is as follows:  
  randomly generated hexagonal maze on an isometric grid, with a classic top-down view.  
  continuous arrow-key based character movement and sprite animation loops for walking and idle.  
  a flower-watering animation to be triggered when emsie gets close enough to a flower.  
  a depleting stamina bar that increments as emsie walks around the maze.  
  on-screen button options to replay a maze or generate a new one.  
  a neatly-packaged game file for others to download and play.  
  
Tech stack (so far):  
  Python, Pygame
