things for upscaling and optimization:

package (init, packaging, core, oop, modules, classes, methods, packets)

things to troubleshoot:
use pygame.keydown to update direction of walk 
when pygame.keyup, iterate through pressed keys, prioritizing down, up, right, and left facing

things to redo:
move sprites into sprite sheet
draw rectangle class?

things to add in the foreseeable future:
watering animation per angle (make it obvious from the back!)
celebration animation!



things to add later:
on screen buttons for retry and new maze:
-time fast forward and time go backward transition animations (clock)
-game icon!


endgame:
convert to .exe for publishing
fit different resolutions?
