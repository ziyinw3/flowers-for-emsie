things for upscaling and optimization:

package (init, packaging, core, oop, modules, classes, methods, packets)



things to redo:
move sprites into sprite sheet
draw rectangle class?

things to add in the foreseeable future:
watering animation per angle (make it obvious from the back!)
celebration animation!



things to add later:
on screen buttons for retry and new maze:
-time fast forward and time go backward transition animations (clock)


endgame:
convert to .exe for publishing
fit different resolutions?
